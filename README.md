# Retro Rotations
## Hannah Kai Fong

This p5.js sketch is designed to create a captivating zoom background that seamlessly loops. It’s built with parameters that make it adaptable to various scales.

My initial intentions for this design was to further explore [a gif](https://bestanimations.com/Balls&Buttons/amazing-3d-computer-ball-sphere-art-animated-gif-6.gif) I had found that involved some very satisfying movement. I was completely mesmerised by how effective cycling through colour could be and wanted to attempt the same technique. I was also inspired by [Lucy Jaegers’ previous work](https://nuku.wgtn.ac.nz/courses/19107/files/1868546?module_item_id=402239), which had been shown to us in class. Again, her use of colour shifting was particularly appealing to me.

My initial sketch was intended to be a stationary image ie. the movements wouldn’t move from side to side and it would only explore the colour shifting idea. As we learnt more about animating motion, my intentions for the project moved past this. 

The hardest part of this project was creating the shapes that make up the sphere. I spent a lot of time adjusting fractions of the shape to make this work. The final sphere is not completely accurate to the original gif, but I found that it could create a similar feel and visual trickery. 

I then began to try to cycle the colours around the spheres. Unfortunately some of my more elegant coding attempts failed and I ended up using a seemingly unnecessarily number of arrays and if-statements. However, this technique worked and I decided I could return to code’s style later if I had time. 

Initially I wanted to shift between two colours like Lucy Jaegers’ piece, but after some testing I decided this didn’t work. In order for the 3Dish illusion to work i had to use a dark and light tone with 2 sets of colour gradients that transformed into and out of each colour extreme. Basically I had to make the colour shift cyclic and shifting between 2 colours wasn't giving this effect. 
I came across my final colour palette by processing a gradient with curves in Procreate. I wanted to end up with something that set my spheres apart from the original gif and I accidentally created a retro-organic gradient that did this. 

Once I got the sphere working at imitating the 3D effect from the original inspiration. I wanted to start making bigger efforts to set myself apart from my source material. To replicate my initial sketch, I tested placing the sphere within grids, playing with the size of these grids and the number of spheres drawn. Although my wallpaper now looked similar to my initial idea, there was something a bit boring and static about it. 
As I hadn’t had much opportunity to explore other motion skills taught to us in class, I thought I’d give side scrolling a go. I considered the other skills taught to us in class e.g. noise and easing, but these didn’t feel like they had a place in the piece I was creating, so I ruled them out. This completely changed the feel of the canvas, giving it more energy and dimension. I liked how this was looking so I continued to explore this idea in combination with the grid element. Another happy accident occurred when the spheres started crossing over one another in the centre. This furthered the dimension of the piece and felt like it stood apart from the source material in a big way. 
I think the 70s colour palette ended up naturally moving me towards a more [70s psychedelic aesthetic](https://www.pinterest.com/vivianic/psychedelic/). This isn’t something that tends to appeal to me and I had imagined my final design feeling calmer, however I think the psychedelic look suits the brief really well. The final design still has more breathing space than actual psychedelic art, which I appreciate. 

I did experiment with moving away from the 70s colour palette at the end of the project, but I returned to it as it felt right with the sphere shapes. I think this is probably because of its visual similarity to 70s flower power patterns [like this](https://carmengonzalezartist.com/product/delicate-flower-power-20x20-acrylic-on-canvas-original/) that I've always had an affinity with.

There are still some major issues with the set up of my code and unfortunately I don’t have the time to fix them. If given extra time, I would seperate the colour arrays from the function and turn them into variables or nested arrays. This would allow me to condense the two sphere drawing functions that the code relies on. I would also attempt to find a better solution than if-statements inside the sphere drawing function. Although this works perfectly, the repetitiveness of the code suggests there’s likely a loop to fix this. 

Having said this, I’m really pleased with the final design. I think it has more of a unique voice than I thought it would and has evolved away from my original design in a very fun, energetic way. Although there are some issues with the style of the code, I think my piece addresses the ‘zoom background’ aspect of the brief in an interesting way and creates its own unique ambience.
