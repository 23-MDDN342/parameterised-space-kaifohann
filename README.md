colour shifting:
My first sketch is based off of this gif:
https://bestanimations.com/Balls&Buttons/amazing-3d-computer-ball-sphere-art-animated-gif-6.gif

I find this animation completely mesmerising and would love to see how I could expand on it. For my sketch I have turned the basic sphere shape into a pattern as I think this will look more satisfying in wallpaper format. I have left the sketch as black and white for now because I'd like to test a few options in combination with the animation effect. To distinguish my own work from the original gif, I'd quite like to work with a shift between 2 colours rather than a whole spectrum, but the effect of this needs to be tested in animation.

I was inspired also by Lucy Jaegers' previous work. I was shown this piece last year and remember finding the effect of this piece quite hypnotising. My wallpaper will attempt to recreate this effect - hopefully imitating the colour shifting and movement this wallpaper has.
